## Description
A collection of 3d printed length gauges for common hobby plunger tubes, to help with cutting them to size or figuring out which ones you have on hand. 

Each gauge has two sizes on it. SLAB/Skewer, Talon Claw/Caliburn, and Lynx/Minx. 

The gauges have a little loop on one end for a zip tie or 10-32 bolt+nut to make it into a sort of keyring type thing with all the gauges in one place. 
You could also just tie them to a length of cord and have them hang off of a workbench or something like that.


Here's the individual plunger tube sizes:
- SLAB 4"
- Skewer 5.2"
- Talon Claw 5.72"
- Caliburn 7.31"
- Lynx 8"
- Minx 5.5"


I print these at 20% infill with 5 walls.
